            <h3>Formation and early years (2004–2009)</h3>
            <p>
                Motionless in White was founded in summer of 2004 by members Chris Motionless, who played guitar and lead vocals, 
                Angelo Parente on drums, Frank Polumbo on guitar and Kyle White on bass during high school. For their first two shows
                at the Northeast Fair in Pittston, PA, the band was known as "One Way Ticket" and then as "When Breathing Stops" for
                the remainder of 2004. On New Year's Day of 2005, they settled on their current name. Chris Motionless and other
                members have noted bands such as Poison the Well, Slipknot, Marilyn Manson, Johnny Cash, Depeche Mode, and other musical
                groups as their inspiration. In 2005, they released their self-distributed demo.

                Within the year after the release of their demo, new member Josh Balz was added as the band's keyboardist, Frank
                Polumbo took over on bass and new members, Michael Costanza and Thomas "TJ" Bell, were added to the band as the new guitarists, 
                moving Chris Motionless solely to lead vocals. The band was discovered by Zach Neil while performing at a local nightclub called The Staircase. 
                Neil signed the band first to management and then later to his record label Masquerade recordings. They recorded their first EP The Whorror which
                was produced by Zach Neil and mixed by Dan Malsch and released it through Masquerade Recordings/Warner music group in 2007.
